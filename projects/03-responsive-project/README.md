# Project: Print & Responsive Design

**DUE:** Wednesday, March 25, Noon.

This project is worth **fifteen (15) points.**

## Instructions

Using the HTML and CSS files you created in the last exercise ([02-css-project](https://github.com/umiami-front-end/02-css-project)), create versions for print, mobile phones and tablets.

You may have to modify the HTML and CSS you wrote in the first project to make it easier to craft your designs. You are permitted to do this, but again, without use of `id` or `class` attributes / selectors.

You may work in git as you see fit. If you work in branches, *be sure to merge them into master before submitting.*

Group your changes in related commits â€” if you are working on print, focus on that and commit changes as you go; mobile changes should be in separate commits.

Email Prof. Brown the link to your *repo* no later than noon on Wednesday, March 25.

### Print

Be sure to account for all elements of your design when transitioning it from a web medium to print. These were covered in class and in the exercise. Feel free to be creative, but your submission should adhere to the best practices of print design.

A goal: Make your printed version take up half a sheet of paper (4.25" x 5.5") or the size of an index card (3" x 5") as if it were going to be stored in a recipe box. This is *not* a requirement, but an idea to focus on given the content (a recipe) and medium (print).

### Responsive

For the responsive version of the site, create one design for a mobile phone and one for a tablet.

These will be tested against a random device included in Firefox's Responsive Design Mode. You are not designing for a specific device, rather finding suitable breakpoints for your design. Both the mobile and tablet versions will be viewed in portrait mode.

When including your image, it should be responsive and there should be different versions for the mobile and tablet designs. The same visual may be used, but it should be re-cropped and exported to fit the medium. There should be three files.

Be sure to account for all elements of your design which need to be adjusted for a mobile and/or tablet design. These were covered in class and in the exercise.

Feel free to be creative, but your submission should adhere to the best practices of responsive design.


## Reminder

Images must be stored in your repo. Do not "hot link." All content must be sourced. Failure to adhere to these requirements will constitute a lapse of web ethics and result in a zero (0) on this assignment.


## Grading

Five (5) points are earned for print. Ten (10) points are earned for responsive (five (5) for mobile, five (5) for tablet).

Projects submitted past the due date will receive a zero (0).

Submissions will receive deductions for any missed steps as well as the following:

- Invalid HTML (-2)
- Limited / incomplete designs
- Lack of print / mobile / tablet design
- Incorrect use of absolute/relative units
- Does not account for print best practices
- Does not account for mobile best practices



**Good luck!**
