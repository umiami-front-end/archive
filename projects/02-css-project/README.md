# Project: CSS Selectors & Units

**DUE:** Wednesday, March 4, Noon.

This project is worth **ten (10) points.**


## Instructions

This project is designed to have you build a simple web page and focus on applying selectors and use relative units. The outcome of this will project will serve as a foundation for future assignments.

You will need to re-do the recipe page assigned in `01-html-css-review`. Be sure to follow the best practices covered during the third week of class.

Find a new recipe from [Public Domain Recipes](https://publicdomainrecipes.org), which has at least five ingredients and five steps. Find a photo to accompany the recipe on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). Do not use code to re-size the image; edit it in Photoshop so its dimensions fit your design. Your image may not exceed 300kb in file size. (It probably should be much less.)

You may create any design you want, but it needs to be more than just styling fonts and colors. Make it look a lot better than what appears on the Public Domain Recipes web site. Make it presentable, as if you were creating your own recipe site.

Your code must adhere to the limitations below:

  **CSS Selectors:** You are not permitted to add any `id` or `class` attribute to the HTML. Therefore, you may not use id or class selectors in your CSS. You may use type, attribute, descendant, child, general sibling, adjacent sibling selectors, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements and the comma (combining) selector in your CSS.

  *Note:* I realize there's nothing keeping you from sticking to only using type and descendant selectors (which you are probably already familiar and comfortable with). Try using this opportunity to experiment with the new selectors. In a real-world situation, it may not be the ideal selector to use. But this is an opportunity to practice with a design you have control over. :)

  **CSS Units:** You may only use pixels with the `border` property. All other units must be a relative unit, either `rem` or `em`. You are free to choose whichever you prefer.

Please name your file after the recipe (i.e. `waffles.html`). Store all work in a new repository.

Email Prof. Brown the link to your *repo* no later than noon on Wednesday, March 4.


### Displaying Your Work as a Web Page

*Skip this step if you do not want to see your page live on the web.*

On GitHub, in the repo settings, scroll down to GitHub Pages. Under source, choose the branch which your work resides. The page should build after your next push to GitHub.

Push the changes to your repo.

## Reminder

Images must be stored in your repo. Do not "hot link." All content must be sourced. Failure to adhere to these requirements will constitute a lapse of web ethics and result in a zero (0) on this assignment.


## Grading

Projects submitted past the due date will receive a zero (0).

Submissions will receive deductions for any missed steps as well as the following:

- Limited/incomplete designs
- Failure to follow best practices
- Use of ids, classes in HTML
- Use of id and/or class selectors in CSS
- Use of pixels (other than for the `border` property)

**Good luck!**
