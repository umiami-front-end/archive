# Project: HTML & CSS Review

**DUE:** Friday, January 24, 2020

This project is worth **five (5) points.**

## Instructions

This project is designed to have you build a simple web page. You are to hand-code your HTML and CSS. Do not use a framework such as Bootstrap or Foundation. Do not use a program (i.e. Dreamweaver, Sketch) which can generate code for you. The outcome of this assignment will serve as a foundation for future ones.

1. Find a recipe from [Public Domain Recipes](https://publicdomainrecipes.org). The recipe should have at least five ingredients and five steps (instructions).

2. Find a photo to accompany the recipe on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). Note the photographer's name for credit later. Save the original image in a directory called `original` in your repo. Edit the image in Photoshop so its dimensions fit your design. Your image may not exceed 300kb in file size. (It probably should be much less.) Store the edited image in an `img` or `images` directory.

3. Name your html files so it reflects what your recipe is. For instance, if your recipe is for chicken noodle soup, name it `chicken-noodle-soup.html`. Create a proper document structure, use proper semantic and structural tags to describe your content (i.e., if it's a list, it should be a list). Your recipe must also include the recipe name, yield, ingredients, instructions, author and link back to the original recipe. Include the image and source. Make sure your HTML is [valid](https://validator.w3.org).

4. Add styling to the page. Store this `.css` file in a `css` directory. You may create any design you want, but it needs to be more than just styling fonts and colors. Take into account font pairings, balanced whitespace, page layout, link colors, hover effect, etc. Make it look much better than what appears on the Public Domain Recipes web site. Make it presentable, as if you were creating your own recipe site.

5. When finished, commit your work to a new GitHub repository called `html-css-review`.

6. *Skip this step if you do not want to see your page live on the web.*

	On GitHub, in the repo settings, scroll down to GitHub Pages. Under source, choose the branch which your work resides. The page should build after your next push to GitHub.

7. Push the changes to your repo.

8. Email Prof. Brown the link to your *repo* no later than *NOON on Friday, January 24, 2020*. Early submissions are welcome.


## Reminder

Images must be stored in your GitHub repository. Do not "hot link." All content must be sourced. Failure to adhere to these requirements will constitute a lapse of web ethics and result in a zero (0) on this assignment.


## Grading

Projects submitted past the due date will receive a zero (0).

The purpose of this assignment is to gauge your HTML and CSS knowledge. No deductions will be issued for mistakes, though feedback will be provided. Be sure to give a full, honest effort so we can determine what areas you may need review.

**Good luck!**
